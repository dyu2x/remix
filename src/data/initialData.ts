    content: `## Why Water Quality Matters

Water quality is the foundation of successful Clarias batrachus aquaculture. Poor water conditions lead to stress, disease, and mortality.

### Key Parameters

**Temperature:** 24-30°C is optimal. Below 24°C slows metabolism; above 32°C causes stress.

**pH:** 6.5-9.0 is ideal. Acidic water below 6.5 affects nutrient absorption.

**Dissolved Oxygen:** Above 5 mg/L is required. Below 3 mg/L risks mass mortality.

### Monitoring Tips

- Test water daily during first month of stocking
- Use aerators during hot weather
- Perform partial water changes weekly
- Monitor ammonia and nitrite levels regularly`

    content: `## Planning Your Hatchery

A well-designed hatchery system is essential for raising healthy Clarias batrachus fingerlings.

### Tank Selection

Choose tanks made from food-grade materials. Circular tanks are preferred for better water circulation and waste removal.

### Filtration System

Install a biofilter to maintain water quality. Mechanical filters remove solid waste, while biological filters process harmful ammonia into less toxic compounds.

### Aeration

Proper aeration ensures adequate dissolved oxygen. Use air stones or paddle wheel aerators depending on tank size and stocking density.`

    content: `## The Critical First Month

The first 30 days after stocking are crucial for Clarias batrachus fingerling survival and growth.

### Day 1-7: Acclimation

Gradually acclimate fingerlings to pond water temperature. Avoid sudden temperature changes which can cause shock.

### Day 8-14: Feeding

Begin feeding high-protein starter feed. Feed small amounts 4-5 times daily to prevent overfeeding and water pollution.

### Day 15-21: Health Monitoring

Watch for signs of disease such as erratic swimming or lesions. Remove any sick fish immediately to prevent spreading.

### Day 22-30: Growth Assessment

Monitor growth rates and adjust feeding based on consumption patterns. Healthy fingerlings should show steady weight gain.`
